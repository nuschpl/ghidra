    <H1 align="center">Theming User Help</H1>

    <H2>Description</H2>

    <P>The Theming feature allows users to customize the colors, fonts, and icons used throughout
    the application. The active theme determines the Java LookAndFeel, whether the theme should use
    light or dark defaults, and any custom colors, fonts, and icons that override the default
    values. Users can can easily switch between any of the built-in themes or any saved themes from
    their home application directory</P>

    <P>Users can also edit and create their own themes using the Theme Editor. Custom themes are
    stored in the users &lt;application dir&gt;/themes. These are simple text files that can
    easily be modified using any text editor. Also, users can share themes by exporting them to a
    file that can be given to other users who can them import them into their own system.</P>

    <H2>Theme Dialog<A name="Edit_Theme"></A></H2>

    <P>The Theme Dialog is the primary means for creating, editing, and saving themes.</P>

    <P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images/ThemeDialog.png"><BR>
     &nbsp;</P>

    <P>The Theme Dialog consists of a theme comboBox and a tabbed set of tables that display the
    values for every color property, font property, and icon property defined by either the Java
    LookAndFeel or the Ghidra application. All Ghidra defined properties start with "color.",
    "font.", or "icon." depending on whether the the property is a color, font, or icon
    respectively. All other properties are defined by the Java LookAndFeel.</P>

    <P>Each table entry shows the property id string and then the current value, the theme value,
    and the default color. Most often, the three values are equal. If the theme value is different
    from the default value, that means that the active theme has overridden the default value for
    that property. If the current value is different from the theme value, that means the user has
    changed that value, but not yet saved the changes back to the theme.</P>

    <P>Individual values can be changed by double clicking the Id or Current Color column. This
    will bring up an appropriate editor for changing the value. When editing a value, the change
    takes place immediately in the application so you can see the effect. When you leave the
    specific property editor, you have the choice of keeping the change or canceling and having it
    revert back to its previous value.</P>

    <P>If any values have been changed, the "Save" button will become enabled, allowing you to save
    any changes you have made. (Hitting "Dismiss" will also give the the option to save.) If the
    current theme is a built-in theme, you will first have to supply a new theme name. If the
    current theme is a not a built-in theme, you will have the option to overwrite the existing
    theme or supplying a new name to save it as a new theme.</P>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3>Color Editor</H3>

      <P>When you double-click on a color value, the Edit Color dialog appears.</P>

      <P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images/ColorEditor.png"><BR>
       &nbsp;</P>

      <P>Any change you make in the editor is applied to the application immediately. If you press
      the OK button, the change will stay. If you press the Cancel button, the color will revert
      back to the original color.</P>

      <H3>Font Editor</H3>

      <P>When you double-click on a font value, the Edit Font dialog appears.</P>

      <P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images/FontEditor.png"><BR>
       &nbsp;</P>

      <P>Any change you make in the editor is applied to the application immediately. If you press
      the OK button, the change will stay. If you press the Cancel button, the font will revert
      back to the original font.</P>

      <H3>Icon Editor</H3>

      <P>When you double-click on an Icon value, the Edit Icon dialog appears.</P>

      <P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images/IconEditor.png"><BR>
       &nbsp;</P>

      <P>The Edit Icon dialog has a drop down text field where you can find any existing icon on
      the classpath. If you want to choose an Icon from the file system, press the "..." button and
      a FileChooser will appear, allowing you to pick an icon file from anywhere in the filesystem.
      Any change you make in the editor is applied to the application immediately. If you press the
      OK button, the change will stay. If you press the Cancel button, the icon will revert back to
      the original icon.</P>

    <H2>Theme Actions</H2>

    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <H3>Switching Themes</H3>

      <P>To change the current theme, first bring up the <A href="#Edit_Theme">Theme Dialog</A>.
      The Theme Dialog can be invoked from the Ghidra Project Window menu using the
      <B>Edit</B><IMG alt="" src="images/arrow.gif" border="0"><B>Theme</B> menu. Then select
      a theme from the combo box at the top of the Theme Editor dialog.</P>

      <H3>Modifying Theme Values</H3>

      <P>All the colors, fonts, and icons that have been externalized can be modified using the <A
      href="#Edit_Theme">Theme Dialog</A>. The Theme Dialog can be invoked from the
      Ghidra Project Window using the
      <B>Edit</B><IMG alt="" src="images/arrow.gif" border="0"><B>Theme</B> menu. Choose the
      tab for the appropriate type and double-click on the id column or current value column of the
      item you want to change. An editor for that type will appear.</P>

      <H3>Reseting Theme Values</H3>

      <P>To reset an individual value back to its original theme value, invoke the <A href=
      "#Edit_Theme">Theme Dialog</A> using the <B>Edit</B> <IMG alt="" src="images/arrow.gif"
      border="0"><B>Theme</B> menu. Switch to the appropriate tab for either colors, fonts, or
      icons. Right-click on the row of the value you want to reset and choose the <B>Restore
      Value</B> menu item.</P>

      <H3>Reseting All Theme Values<A name="Reset_Theme_Values"></A></H3>

      <P>To reset all values back to the original values established by the current theme, invoked
      the <B>Edit</B><IMG alt="" src="images/arrow.gif" border="0"><B>Theme Actions</B> <IMG
      alt="" src="images/arrow.gif" border="0"><B>Reset Theme Values</B> menu.</P>

      <H3>Saving Themes</H3>

      <P>After making changes to one or more theme values, the <A href="#Edit_Theme">Theme
      Dialog's</A> <B>Save</B> button will be enabled. Pressing the <B>Save</B> button will give
      the user the option of creating a new theme or overwriting the current them (if the current
      theme is not a built-in theme). Also, users will have the options of saving a theme if they
      dismiss the Theme Dialog while there are changes to one or more theme values.</P>

      <H3>Deleting Themes<A name="Delete_Theme"></A></H3>

      <P>To delete a custom saved theme, invoked the <B>Edit</B><IMG alt="" src=
      "images/arrow.gif" border="0"><B>Theme Actions</B> <IMG alt="" src=
      "images/arrow.gif" border="0"><B>Delete Theme...</B> menu. This will bring up a dialog
      with a list of themes that can be deleted. Select the theme to delete and press the <B>Ok</B>
      button.</P>

      <H3>Exporting Themes&gt;<A name="Export_Theme"></A></H3>

      <P>To export a theme so that it can be shared with others, invoke the <B>Edit</B> <IMG alt=""
      src="images/arrow.gif" border="0"><B>Theme Actions</B> <IMG alt="" src=
      "images/arrow.gif" border="0"><B>Export Theme...</B> menu. You will first be asked if
      you want to export as a regular theme file or as a Zip file. The Zip file option is useful if
      the current theme has icon values that are not included with standard Ghidra. In that case,
      the Zip file will include those non standard icon files.</P>

      <H3>Importing Themes<A name="Import_Theme"></A></H3>

      <P>To import a theme, invoke the <B>Edit</B> <IMG alt="" src="images/arrow.gif" border=
      "0"><B>Theme Actions</B> <IMG alt="" src="images/arrow.gif" border="0"><B>Import
      Theme...</B> menu. A file chooser dialog will appear allowing the user to choose a theme file
      to import. The selected file can be either a standard theme file or a Zip file containing the
      theme file and any non-standard icon files defined by that theme.</P>

      <H3>Reloading Default Values</H3>

      <P>XThis action causes Ghidra to reload all theme default values. It is really only useful
      for developers who are actively making changes to theme.properties files. To activate this
      action, press the refresh button <IMG alt="" src="images/reload3.png" border="0"> in the top
      right corner of the <A href="#Edit_Theme">Theme Dialog</A>.</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>

    <H2>Theme Property Names</H2>

    <P>Theme Property Names (also referred to as ids or keys) that are defined by Ghidra use a
    common format to help make sorting and viewing properties more intuitive as to their use. See
    the <A href="ThemingDeveloperDocs.html#Resource_Ids">Developer Documentation</A> for more details on the property id
    format and naming conventions.</P>

    <H2>Theme Files</H2>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>

      <P>Theme Files are used to store saved custom themes. They are simple text files and are 
      stored in the user's home application directory. The first three properties are always the
      theme name, the look and feel name, and whether the theme uses standard defaults or dark
      defaults. Then there is just a list of overridden property "name = value" lines.So the format
      is:</P>
    <CODE>
	<PRE>
        name = [theme name]
        lookAndFeel = [lookAndFeel name]
        useDarkDefaults = [true or false]
        
        [theme id 1]= [color, icon, or font value]
        [theme id 2]= [color, icon, or font value]
        [theme id 3]= [color, icon, or font value]
        [theme id 4]= [color, icon, or font value]
        ...
	</PRE>
	</CODE>

     <BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>Example:</P>
	<PRE>
        name = BigFontTheme
        lookAndFeel = Nimbus
        useDarkDefaults = false
		
        color.bg = Black
        color.bg.foo = #012345
        [color]Panel.background = Red
        font.button = dialog-PLAIN-14
        icon.refresh = images/reload3.png    
        color.bg.bar = color.bg.foo   
        color.bg.xxx = [color]Panel.background
	</PRE>


      <P>Each property line is expected to begin with either "color.", "font.", or "icon." Since
      java defined properties don't start with these prefixes, they will have "[color]", "[font]",
      or "[icon]" prepended to their property name. These are just there for the purposes of
      parsing this file. When the properties are used in Ghidra, those bracketed prefixes are
      removed.</P>

      <P>Also, note that the values of these properties can reference other property names. If the
      right side of the assignment is a property name and not a value, then it must also use the
      bracketed prefix if the property name doesn't start with "color.", "font.", or "icon."</P>

      <H3>Specifying Theme Property Values</H3>
      <P>Specifying property values varies depending on whether it is a color, font, or icon. Fonts
      and icons also support specifying modifiers. For a complete description of how to specify
      these values, see the <A href="ThemingDeveloperDocs.html#Theme_Property_Values">Developer Documentation</A>.
