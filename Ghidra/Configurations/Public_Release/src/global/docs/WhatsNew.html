<H1>Ghidra: NSA Reverse Engineering Software</H2>
    
    <P>
    Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework developed by NSA's Research Directorate.
    This framework includes a suite of full-featured, high-end software analysis tools that enable
    users to analyze compiled code on a variety of platforms including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
    Capabilities include disassembly, assembly, decompilation, debugging, emulation, graphing, and scripting, along with
    hundreds of other features.  Ghidra supports a wide variety of processor instruction sets and 
    executable formats and can be run in both user-interactive and automated modes.  Users may also
    develop their own Ghidra plug-in components and/or scripts using the exposed API.  In addition there are
    numerous ways to extend Ghidra such as new processors, loaders/exporters, automated analyzers,
    and new visualizations.
    </P>
    
    <P>
    In support of NSA's Cybersecurity mission, Ghidra was built to solve scaling and teaming problems
    on complex SRE efforts and to provide a customizable and extensible SRE research platform.  NSA
    has applied Ghidra SRE capabilities to a variety of problems that involve analyzing malicious
    code and generating deep insights for NSA analysts who seek a better understanding of potential
    vulnerabilities in networks and systems.

    <H1>What's New in Ghidra 11.0</H1>
    
    <H2>The not-so-fine print: Please Read!</H2>
    
	<P>Ghidra 11.0 is fully backward compatible with project data from previous releases.
	However, programs and data type archives which are created or modified in 11.0 will not be useable by an earlier Ghidra version. </P>

	<P>This release includes new features and capabilities, performance improvements, quite a few bug fixes, and many pull-request
	contributions. Thanks to all those who have contributed their time, thoughts, and code. The Ghidra user community thanks you too!</P>
	
	<P>IMPORTANT: Ghidra requires Java 17 JDK to run.  A newer version of Java may be acceptable but has not been fully tested.  Please see the
	<a href="InstallationGuide.html">Ghidra Installation Guide</a> for additional information.</P>
	
	<P>NOTE: Please note that any programs imported with a Ghidra beta version or code built directly from source outside of a release tag may not be compatible
	and may have flaws that won't be corrected by using this new release.  Any programs analyzed from a beta or other local master source build should be considered
	experimental and re-imported and analyzed with a release version.  As an example, Ghidra 10.1 beta had an import flaw affecting symbol demangling that was not
	correctable. Programs imported with previous release versions should upgrade correctly through various automatic upgrade mechanisms.  Any program
	you will continue to reverse engineer should be imported fresh with a release version or a build you trust with the latest code fixes.</P>

	<P>NOTE: Ghidra Server: The Ghidra 11.x server is compatible with Ghidra 9.2 and later Ghidra clients.  Ghidra 11.x
	clients are compatible with all 10.x and 9.x servers.  Although, due to potential Java version differences, it is recommended
	that Ghidra Server installations older than 10.2 be upgraded.  Those using 10.2 and newer should not need a server upgrade.</P>
	
	<P>NOTE: Platform-specific native components can be built directly from a release distribution.
	The distribution currently provides Linux x86-64, Windows x86-64, and macOS x86-64 native components.  If you have another platform,
	for example a macOS M1 based system or a Linux ARM variant, the <span class="gcode">support/buildNatives</span> script can build the Decompiler,
	demangler, and legacy PDB executables for your plaform.  Please see the "Building Ghidra Native Components" section in the
	<a href="InstallationGuide.html#Build">Ghidra Installation Guide</a> for additional information.</P>

    <H2>Additional Bug Fixes and Enhancements</H2>
    <P> Numerous other bug fixes and improvements are fully listed in the <a href="ChangeHistory.html">ChangeHistory</a> file.</P>
